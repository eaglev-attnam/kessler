# Kessler
Source code and assets for the Ludum Dare 50 game "Kessler"

This should contain everything needed to open and edit the game using Unity 2020.3.32f1

One notable exception: the font file I used for the game restricts sharing. You can fix this by importing a font file named "nulshock bd.ttf" to Assets/Fonts (or assigning a different font to everything that complains)
